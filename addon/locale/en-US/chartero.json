        "dateTime": "The trend of reading duration with date: the x-axis represents the date, the y-axis represents the reading duration of the day. When there are multiple attachments under this item with reading records, there will be multiple curves, click the legend below to hide this curve. Drag horizontally to select a period of time for magnification, hold down shift to pan the curve.",
        "pageTime": "The bar chart represents the total reading time of each page, hold down Ctrl and click on a page to open the PDF and jump to the corresponding page. When there are multiple attachments under this item with reading records, each page number may correspond to multiple rectangles of different colors, click the legend below to hide the corresponding color rectangle. Drag vertically to select a page range for magnification, hold down shift to pan the chart.",
        "sankey": "The Sankey diagram is used to represent the relationship between the journal and the author. The three columns from left to right are the first author, the corresponding author, and the journal/conference name. Literature with only one author or without a journal name will not be displayed in the chart. The 'corresponding author' is defaulted to the last-ranked author, and you can change the default ranking in the preferences: '-1' represents the last place, '0' represents the first place.",
        "gantt": "The Gantt chart can intuitively show the start and end time of the literature read during a period of time. The percentage in the chart represents the ratio of the number of pages read to the total number of pages. Drag the navigation window below to zoom in on the chart, and the selector above can change the sorting method or filter the items to be displayed. When the chart window is too narrow, the title will be automatically hidden, and you can jump in the menu after selecting an item. You can select the header, sorting method, filter items, etc. through the drop-down menu at the top.",
        "network": "The associated literature network shows the relationship between other items associated with this item in the current library. Each bubble represents an item, and the size of the bubble represents the reading duration. By default, only literature directly associated with the 'current item' is loaded. Click on the hollow circle to load literature directly associated with this item, hold down shift and click to collapse the associated literature of this item. Select a loaded item (solid circle) to jump within the library.",
        "wordCloud": "The word cloud can summarize all the tags, titles, authors, etc. of all items under this category, and display them in the form of a word cloud. The font size in the word cloud represents the number of times the word appears or the total reading duration of all items under this tag. Hover over a word to view the number of times the word appears in the library or the total reading duration of this tag. In tag mode, you can filter out unnecessary tags, click save to take effect permanently, click cancel to be effective only once.",

        "pie": "The pie chart shows the relationship between the reading duration and the number of documents of all tags under the current category.
